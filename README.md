# Impulse-To-Insight

ABSTRACT  :

In the modern day, when you need to extract insights from spoken content in this age
of information overload, our system is one that excels in converting speech to text with
high accuracy. Personalization - the product does transcription of speech but also identifies
which speaker is speaking through advanced technologies such as ASR (Automatic Speech
Recognition) and Speaker Diarization.
The transcribed text is then parsed by a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system,
such as NLTK, which generates concise summaries of the transcripts. By automating this
process, it acts as a time-saver and boosts productivity, thereby easing the management of
huge volumes of audio information for businesses, academics, and media professionals. Built
for fast processing and efficient access to information, our system represents an improvement
in speech processing technology.
